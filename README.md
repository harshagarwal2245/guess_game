Welcome to my first Rust project!  
A simple command-line **"Guess the Number"** game to get started with the Rust programming language.

## ðŸ§© Features

- Generates a random secret number between 1 and 100
- Takes user input from the console
- Compares the input with the secret number
- Informs the user if the guess is too small, too big, or correct
- Strong type safety and error handling using Rust best practices
